* Random information that I decided cannot be categorized or I'm just too lazy to write it properly into a blog post/document. 
* These notes can also be used as references for my more formal writings.
* These information should be the last resort as they are likely to be unfiltered and is not organized, try to find information on more proper websites first.

Built using *Vercel*, *Digital Garden*(Obsidian plugin), and *Obsidian*
See the github repository for this digital garden [here](https://github.com/Wittummm/unturned-random-info/).
