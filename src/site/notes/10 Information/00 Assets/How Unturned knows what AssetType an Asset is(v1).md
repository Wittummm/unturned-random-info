Version 1 is the confusing one, version 2 is quite simple as it is separated into `Metadata.Type` which states the AssetType and `Asset.Type` is the Asset's type. When the AssetType is stated using `Metadata.Type` the AssetType does not need to be defined by `Asset.Type`(? verify this)

The `Type` is badly designed as it has 2 uses: the AssetType("ItemAsset") itself and the Asset's type("Large"). 

#### Examples
`Type Vehicle` → refers to `VehicleAsset`
`Type Large` → refers to an `ObjectAsset` that is large

All registers of the `Type` to `AssetType` [here](https://github.com/Unturned-Datamining/Unturned-Datamining/blob/9fb0d6c921353cec991254cbff98b6d3d1ba37a9/Assembly-CSharp/SDG.Unturned/UnturnedNexus.cs)
