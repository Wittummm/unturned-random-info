(Name) (Keyword) (#N OR Extra) (Tag1)\_(Tag2)\_(TagN)\_(MODTAG)
- Name = the name of the object, excluding the main keyword/concept of it
- Keyword = the main keyword/characteristic of the object like "Traffic Cone", "Sign", "Apartment", "Warehouse". There may be multiple keywords if both are almost equally good for the specific object, the keywords should be separated with `/`.
- \#N or Extra = if `#N` then #1, #2 and so on | if `Extra` then it could be colors(red, green, etc) or some extra detail, that is less important than name. if there are many extras include them all in the parentheses and separate by `,`(no space)
- Tag = a tag for the object. There are many types of tags but they all do the same thing, labeling the object.
- MODTAG = the tag/suffix for the specific mod, usually abbreviated and in uppercase.

Tags should not repeat the name(some exceptions may be made although it should be heavily considered), for example:
-   X's Twitch Billboard #1 Billboard_Neon_JB → should not have Billboard tag as it is redundant 
Tag types from first to last sorted:
1. Type → Decal = literal types that are explicitly defined in games
2. Abstract Type(Categories) → Billboard, Advert, TrafficControl 
3. Characteristics → Large(Taller), Medium(Tall), Small(Short), Neon, OnNight(something changes at night)

#### Examples correctly following this convention:
- Traffic Cone Large_TP
- Traffic Cone Small_TP
- Traffic Drum/Barrel TP
- Mansion #1 (Pool)  U-Shaped_MP
- Deco Skyscraper #1 BP
- Store #1 (Tech) Small_SE
- Store #2 (Hardware) Medium_SE
- Car Wash #1 NightLight_SE
- Hotel #1 Large_BP
