## How to
* You can enable batching in your level/map by doing `"Batching_Version": 2` in the map `Config.json` 
* You can exclude your asset from batching by setting `Exclude_From_Level_Batching` to <span style="color:red">true</span> in your asset data file.
## Benefits

* Having fewer materials allows the game to batch assets better reducing drawcalls.
